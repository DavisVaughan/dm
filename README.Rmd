## Why?

The motivation for the {dm} package is a more sophisticated data management.
{dm} uses the relational data model and its core concept of splitting one table into multiple tables.

```{r draw, echo = FALSE}
dm_nycflights13(cycle = TRUE) %>%
  dm_draw()
```

This has a **hugh advantage**:
The code becomes simpler.

### Example {#example}

As an example, we consider the [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) dataset.
This dataset contains five tables: the main `flights` table with links into the `airlines`, `planes` and `airports` tables, and a `weather` table without an explicit link.

Assume your task is to merge all tables (except the `weather` table).
This cross-referencing is a common first step when modelling or plotting data.

In {dm} the basic element is [a `dm` object](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm-class-and-basic-operations.html).
You can create it with `dm_nycflights13()` for the example data.
After that you can use the links between the tables as often as you wish - without explicitly referring to the relations ever again.
The task of joining four tables (`flights`, `airlines`, `planes` and `airports`) boils down to:

```{r}
dm_nycflights13() %>%
  dm_flatten_to_tbl(start = flights)
```

In contrast, using the classical {dplyr} notation you need three `left_join()` calls to merge the `flights` table gradually to `airlines`, `planes` and `airports` tables to create one wide data frame.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

flights %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa"))
```

You can find more information and important terms to jump-start working with {dm} in the article ["Introduction to Relational Data Models"](dm-introduction-relational-data-models.html).

### The Advantages in Brief

The separation into multiple tables achieves several goals:

- **Avoid repetition, conserve memory**: the information related to each airline, airport, and airplane are stored only once
    - name of each airline
    - name, location and altitude of each airport
    - manufacturer and number of seats for each airplane
- **Improve consistency**: for updating any information (e.g. the name of an airport), it is sufficient to update in only one place
- **Segmentation**: information is organized by topic, individual tables are smaller and easier to handle

## Good to Know

Multiple, linked tables are a common concept in database management.
Since many R users have a background in other disciplines, we present six important terms in relational data modeling to jump-start working with {dm}.

### 1) Data frames and tables

A data frame is a fundamental data structure in R.
If you imagine it visually, the result is a typical table structure.
That's why working with data from spreadsheets is so convenient and users of the the popular [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package for data wrangling mainly rely on data frames.

The downside: Data frames and flat file systems like spreadsheets can result in bloated tables, that hold many repetitive values.
Worst case, you have a data frame with multiple columns and in each row only a single value is different.

This calls for a better data organization by utilizing the resemblance between data frames and database tables, which consist of columns and rows, too.
The elements are just called differently:

| Data Frame | Table |
|------------|------------|
| Column     | Attribute  |
| Row        | Tuple     |

Therefore, the separation into multiple tables is a first step that helps data quality.
But without an associated data model you don't take full advantage.
For example, joining is more complicated than it should be.
This is illustrated [above](#example).

With {dm} you can have the best of both worlds: Manage your data as linked tables, then flatten multiple tables into one for your analysis with {dplyr} on an as-needed basis.

### 2) Model

A data model shows the structure between multiple tables that can be linked together.
The `nycflights13` relations can be transferred into the following graphical representation:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dm_nycflights13(cycle = TRUE) %>%
  dm_draw()
```

The `flights` table is linked to three other tables: `airlines`, `planes` and `airports`.
By using directed arrows the visualization explicitly shows the connection between different columns/attributes.
For example: The column `carrier` in `flights` can be joined with the column `carrier` from the `airlines` table.
Further Reading: The {dm} methods for [visualizing data models](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm-visualization.html).

The links between the tables are established through *primary keys* and *foreign keys*.

### 3) Primary Keys

In a relational data model every table needs to have one column/attribute that uniquely identifies a row.
This column is called primary key (abbreviated with pk).
The primary key column has unique values and can't contain `NA` or `NULL` values.
If no such column exists, it is common practice to create a synthetic column of numeric or globally unique identifiers (surrogate key).

In the `airlines` table of `nycflights13` the column `carrier` is the primary key.

Further Reading: The {dm} package offers several function for dealing with [primary keys](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm-class-and-basic-operations.html#pk).

### 4) Foreign Keys

The counterpart of a primary key in one table is the foreign key in another table.
In order to join two tables, the primary key of the first table needs to be available in the second table, too.
This second column is called the foreign key (abbreviated with fk).

For example, if you want to link the `airlines` table in the `nycflights13` data to the `flights` table, the primary key in the `airlines` table is `carrier` which is present as foreign key `carrier` in the `flights` table.

Further Reading: The {dm} functions for working with [foreign keys](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm-class-and-basic-operations.html#foreign-keys).

### 5) Normalization

One main goal is to keep the data organization as clean and simple as possible by avoiding redundant data entries.
Normalization is the technical term that describes this central design principle of a relational data model: splitting data into multiple tables.
A normalized data schema consists of several relations (tables) that are linked with attributes (columns) with primary and foreign keys.

For example, if you want to change the name of one airport in `nycflights13`, you have to change only a single data entry.
Sometimes, this principle is called "single point of truth".

See the [Wikipedia article on database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalisation) for more details.
Consider reviewing the [Simple English version](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalisation) for a gentle introduction.

### 6) Relational Databases

`dm` is built upon relational data models, but it is not a database itself.
Databases are systems for data management and many of them are constructed as relational databases, e.g. SQLite, MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres.
As you can guess from the names of the databases SQL, the **s**tructured **q**uerying **l**anguage plays an important role: It was invented for the purpose of querying relational databases.

Therefore, {dm} can copy data [from and to databases](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/articles/dm.html#copy), and works transparently with both in-memory data and with relational database systems.

## Features

This package helps with many challenges that arise when working with relational data models.

### Compound object

The `dm` class manages several related tables.
It stores both the **data** and the **metadata** in a compound object, and defines operations on that object.
These operations either affect the data (e.g., a filter), or the metadata (e.g., definition of keys or creation of a new table), or both.

- data: a table source storing all tables
- metadata: table names, column names, primary and foreign keys

This concept helps separating the join logic from the code: declare your relationships once, as part of your data, then use them in your code without repeating yourself.


### Storage agnostic

The {dm} package augments [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)/[{dbplyr}](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) workflows.
Generally, if you can use {dplyr} on your data, it's likely that you can use {dm} too.
This includes local data frames, relational database systems, and many more.


### Data preparation

A battery of utilities helps with creating a tidy relational data model.

- Splitting and rejoining tables
- Determining key candidates
- Checking keys and cardinalities


## Example

A readymade `dm` object with preset keys is included in the package:

```{r dm}
library(dm)

dm_nycflights13()
```

The `dm_draw()` function creates a visualization of the entity relationship model:

```{r draw, echo = TRUE}
```

### Filtering and joining {#filter}

Similarly to `dplyr::filter()`, a filtering function `dm_filter()` is available for `dm` objects.
You need to provide the `dm` object, the table whose rows you want to filter, and the filter expression.
The actual effect of the filtering will only be realized once you use `dm_apply_filters`.
Before that, the filter conditions are merely stored within the `dm`.
After using `dm_apply_filters()` a `dm` object is returned whose tables only contain rows that are related to the reduced rows in the filtered table.
This currently only works for cycle-free relationships between the tables.

```{r}
dm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>%
  dm_get_tables() %>%
  map_int(nrow)

dm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>%
  dm_filter(planes, year == 2000, manufacturer == "BOEING") %>%
  dm_apply_filters() %>%
  dm_get_tables() %>%
  map_int(nrow)
```

For joining two tables using their relationship defined in the `dm`, you can use `dm_join_tbl()`:

```{r}
dm_nycflights13(cycle = FALSE) %>%
  dm_join_to_tbl(airports, flights, join = semi_join)
```

In our `dm`, the `origin` column of the `flights` table points to the `airports` table.
Since all `nycflights13`-flights depart from New York, only these airports are included in the semi-join.

### From and to databases

In order to transfer an existing `dm` object to a DB, you can call `dm_copy_to()` with the target DB and the `dm` object:

```{r}
src_sqlite <- src_sqlite(":memory:", create = TRUE)
src_sqlite
nycflights13_remote <- dm_copy_to(src_sqlite, dm_nycflights13(cycle = TRUE))
nycflights13_remote
```

The key constraints from the original object are also copied to the newly created object.
With the default setting `set_key_constraints = TRUE` for `dm_copy_to()`, key constraints are also established on the target DB.
Currently this feature is only supported for MSSQL and Postgres database management systems (DBMS).

It is also possible to automatically create a `dm` object from the permanent tables of a DB.
Again, for now just MSSQL and Postgres are supported for this feature, so the next chunk is not evaluated.
The support for other DBMS will be implemented in a future update.

```{r eval=FALSE}
src_postgres <- src_postgres()
nycflights13_from_remote <- dm_learn_from_db(src_postgres)
```

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

This package follows the tidyverse principles:

- `dm` objects are immutable (your data will never be overwritten in place)
- many functions used on `dm` objects are pipeable (i.e., return new `dm` objects)
- tidy evaluation is used (unquoted function parameters are supported)

The {dm} package builds heavily upon the [{datamodelr} package](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr), and upon the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
We're looking forward to a good collaboration!

The [{polyply} package](https://github.com/russHyde/polyply) has a similar intent with a slightly different interface.

The [{data.cube} package](https://github.com/jangorecki/data.cube) has quite the same intent using `array`-like interface.

Articles in the [{rquery} package](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) discuss [join controllers](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/JoinController.md) and [join dependency sorting](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/DependencySorting.md), with the intent to move the declaration of table relationships from code to data.

The [{tidygraph} package](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph) stores a network as two related tables of `nodes` and `edges`, compatible with {dplyr} workflows.

In object-oriented programming languages, [object-relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) is a similar concept that attempts to map a set of related tables to a class hierarchy.
