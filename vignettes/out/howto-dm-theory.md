Multiple, linked tables are common within computer science. Because many
R users have backgrounds in other disciplines, we present **six
important terms in relational data modeling** to help you to jump-start
working with {dm}. These terms are:

1)  [Data Frames and Tables](#tables)
2)  [Data Model](#model)
3)  [Primary Keys](#pk)
4)  [Foreign Keys](#fk)
5)  [Normalization](#normalization)
6)  [Relational Databases](#relational-databases)

## 1\. Data Frames and Tables

A data frame is a fundamental data structure in R. Columns represent
variables, rows represent observations. In more technical terms: a data
frame is a list of variables of identical length and unique row names.
If you imagine it visually, the result is a typical table structure.
That is why working with data from spreadsheets is so convenient and the
users of the popular [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package for
data wrangling mainly rely on data frames.

The downside is that data frames and flat file systems like spreadsheets
can result in bloated tables because they hold many repetitive values.
In the worst case, a data frame can contain multiple columns with only a
single value different in each row.

This calls for better data organization by utilizing the resemblance
between data frames and database tables, which also consist of columns
and rows. The elements are just named differently:

| Data Frame | Table     |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Column     | Attribute |
| Row        | Tuple     |

Relational databases, unlike data frames, do not keep all data in one
large table but instead split it into multiple smaller tables. That
separation into sub-tables has several advantages:

  - all information is stored only once, avoiding redundancy and
    conserving memory
  - all information needs to be updated only once and in one place,
    improving consistency and avoiding errors that may result from
    updating the same value in multiple locations
  - all information is organized by topic and segmented into smaller
    tables that are easier to handle

It is for these reasons that separation of data helps with data quality,
and they explain the popularity of relational databases in
production-level data management.

The downside of this approach is that it is harder to merge together
information from different data sources and to identify which entities
refer to the same object, a common task when modeling or plotting data.

Thus, to take full advantage of the relational database approach, an
associated data model is needed to overcome the challenges that arise
when working with multiple tables.

Let’s illustrate this challenge with the data from the [`nycflights13`
dataset](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) that contains detailed
information about the 336776 flights that departed from New York City in
2013. The information is stored in five tables.

Details like the full name of an airport are not available immediately;
these can only be obtained by joining or merging the constituent tables,
which can result in long and inflated pipe chains full of `left_join()`,
`anti_join()` and other forms of data merging.

In classical {dplyr} notation, you will need three `left_join()` calls
to merge the `flights` table gradually to `airlines`, `planes` and
`airports` tables to create one wide data frame.

{dm} offers a more elegant and shorter way to combine tables while
augmenting {dplyr}/{dbplyr} workflows.

It is possible to have the best of both worlds: manage your data with
{dm} as linked tables, then flatten multiple tables into one for your
analysis with {dplyr} on an as-needed basis.

The next step is to create a [data model](#model) based on multiple
tables:

## 2\. Data Model

A data model shows the structure between multiple tables that can be
linked together.

The `nycflights13` relations can be transferred into the following
graphical representation:

``` r
dm <- dm_nycflights13(cycle = TRUE) 

dm %>% 
  dm_draw()
```

![](/home/kirill/git/cynkra/cynkra/public/dm/vignettes/out/howto-dm-theory_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

The `flights` table is linked to three other tables: `airlines`,
`planes` and `airports`. By using directed arrows, the visualization
shows explicitly the connection between different columns (they are
called attributes in the relational data sphere).

For example: The column `carrier` in `flights` can be joined with the
column `carrier` from the `airlines` table.

The links between the tables are established through [primary keys](#pk)
and [foreign keys](#fk).

Further Reading: The {dm} methods for [visualizing data
models](https://cynkra.github.io/dm/articles/tech-dm-draw.html).

## 3\. Primary Keys

In a relational data model, every table needs to have **one column or
attribute that uniquely identifies a row**. This column is called the
*primary key* (abbreviated with pk). A primary key can be either an
existing column that satisfies the condition of being unique, or a new
column that assigns an identifier.

Example: In the `airlines` table of `nycflights13` the column `carrier`
is the primary key.

You can get all primary keys in a `dm` by calling `dm_get_all_pks()`:

``` r
dm %>%
  dm_get_all_pks()
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   table    pk_col 
#>   <chr>    <keys> 
#> 1 airlines carrier
#> 2 airports faa    
#> 3 planes   tailnum
```

If an attribute is suitable as a primary key, it can be checked with
`dm_enum_pk_candidates()`. Which columns of the `airlines` table can
serve as a primary key?

``` r
dm %>% 
  dm_enum_pk_candidates(airports)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 3
#>   columns candidate why                                                    
#>   <keys>  <lgl>     <chr>                                                  
#> 1 faa     TRUE      ""                                                     
#> 2 lon     TRUE      ""                                                     
#> 3 alt     FALSE     "has duplicate values: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, …"               
#> 4 dst     FALSE     "has duplicate values: A, N, U"                        
#> 5 lat     FALSE     "has duplicate values: 38.88944, 40.63975"             
#> 6 name    FALSE     "has duplicate values: All Airports, Capital City Airp…
#> 7 tz      FALSE     "has duplicate values: -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, …"         
#> 8 tzone   FALSE     "has duplicate values: America/Anchorage, America/Chic…
```

Further Reading: The {dm} package offers several functions for dealing
with [primary
keys](https://cynkra.github.io/dm/articles/tech-dm-class.html#pk).

## 4\. Foreign Keys

The **counterpart of a primary key in one table is the foreign key in
another table**. In order to join two tables, the primary key of the
first table needs to be available in the second table as well. This
second column is called the *foreign key* (abbreviated with fk).

For example, if you want to link the `airlines` table to the `flights`
table, the primary key in `airlines` needs to match the foreign key in
`flights`. This condition is satisfied because the column `carrier` is
present as a primary key in the `airlines` table as well as a foreign
key in the `flights` table. You can find foreign key candidates with the
function `dm_enum_fk_candidates()`, they are marked with `TRUE` in the
`candidate` column.

``` r
dm %>% 
  dm_enum_fk_candidates(flights, airlines)
#> # A tibble: 19 x 3
#>    columns      candidate why                                              
#>    <keys>       <lgl>     <chr>                                            
#>  1 carrier      TRUE      ""                                               
#>  2 tailnum      FALSE     "11080 entries (98.7%) of `flights$tailnum` not …
#>  3 dest         FALSE     "11227 entries (100%) of `flights$dest` not in `…
#>  4 origin       FALSE     "11227 entries (100%) of `flights$origin` not in…
#>  5 air_time     FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#>  6 arr_delay    FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#>  7 arr_time     FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#>  8 day          FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#>  9 dep_delay    FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 10 dep_time     FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 11 distance     FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 12 flight       FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 13 hour         FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 14 minute       FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 15 month        FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 16 sched_arr_t… FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 17 sched_dep_t… FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 18 time_hour    FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
#> 19 year         FALSE     "Can't join on `x$value` x `y$value` because of …
```

After finding and assigning foreign keys, get the name of the set
foreign key:

``` r
dm %>% 
  dm_get_fk(flights, airlines)
#> <list_of<character>[1]>
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "carrier"
```

keys](https://cynkra.github.io/dm/articles/tech-dm-class.html#foreign-keys).

## 5\. Normalization

Normalization is a technical term that describes the **central design
principle of a relational data model**: splitting data into multiple
tables.

A normalized data schema consists of several relations (tables) that are
linked with attributes (columns). The relations can be joined together
by means of [primary](#pk) and [foreign keys](#fk). The main goal of
normalization is to keep data organization as clean and simple as
possible by avoiding redundant data entries.

For example, if you want to change the name of one airport in the
`nycflights13` dataset, you will only need to update a single data
value. This principle is sometimes called the *single point of truth*.

``` r
#  Update in one single location...
airlines[airlines$carrier == "UA", "name"] <- "United broke my guitar"

airlines %>%
  filter(carrier == "UA")
#> # A tibble: 1 x 2
#>   carrier name                  
#>   <chr>   <chr>                 
#> 1 UA      United broke my guitar

# ...propagates to all related records
flights %>%
  left_join(airlines) %>% 
  select(flight, name)
#> Joining, by = "carrier"
#> # A tibble: 336,776 x 2
#>    flight name                    
#>     <int> <chr>                   
#>  1   1545 United broke my guitar  
#>  2   1714 United broke my guitar  
#>  3   1141 American Airlines Inc.  
#>  4    725 JetBlue Airways         
#>  5    461 Delta Air Lines Inc.    
#>  6   1696 United broke my guitar  
#>  7    507 JetBlue Airways         
#>  8   5708 ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
#>  9     79 JetBlue Airways         
#> 10    301 American Airlines Inc.  
#> # … with 336,766 more rows
```

Another way to demonstrate normalization is splitting a table into two
parts.

Let’s look at the `planes` table, which consists of 3322 individual tail
numbers and corresponding information for the specific airplane, like
the year it was manufactured or the average cruising speed.

The function `decompose_table()` extracts two new tables and creates a
new key `model_id`, that links both tables.

This results in a `parent_table` and a `child_table` that differ
massively in the number of rows:

``` r
planes %>%
  decompose_table(model_id, model, manufacturer, type, engines, seats, manufacturer, speed)
#> $child_table
#> # A tibble: 3,322 x 4
#>    tailnum  year engine    model_id
#>    <chr>   <int> <chr>        <int>
#>  1 N10156   2004 Turbo-fan      120
#>  2 N102UW   1998 Turbo-fan       94
#>  3 N103US   1999 Turbo-fan       94
#>  4 N104UW   1999 Turbo-fan       94
#>  5 N10575   2002 Turbo-fan      119
#>  6 N105UW   1999 Turbo-fan       94
#>  7 N107US   1999 Turbo-fan       94
#>  8 N108UW   1999 Turbo-fan       94
#>  9 N109UW   1999 Turbo-fan       94
#> 10 N110UW   1999 Turbo-fan       94
#> # … with 3,312 more rows
#> 
#> $parent_table
#> # A tibble: 147 x 7
#>    model_id model     manufacturer type                 engines seats speed
#>       <int> <chr>     <chr>        <chr>                  <int> <int> <int>
#>  1        1 150       CESSNA       Fixed wing single e…       1     2    90
#>  2        2 172E      CESSNA       Fixed wing single e…       1     4   105
#>  3        3 172M      CESSNA       Fixed wing single e…       1     4   108
#>  4        4 172N      CESSNA       Fixed wing single e…       1     4   105
#>  5        5 206B      BELL         Rotorcraft                 1     5   112
#>  6        6 210-5(20… CESSNA       Fixed wing single e…       1     6    NA
#>  7        7 230       BELL         Rotorcraft                 2    11    NA
#>  8        8 310Q      CESSNA       Fixed wing multi en…       2     6   167

#> # … with 137 more rows
```

While `child_table` contains 3322 unique `tailnum` rows and therefore
consists of 3322 rows, just like the original `planes` table, the
`parent_table` shrunk to just 147 rows, enough to store all relevant
combinations and avoid storing redundant information.

normalization](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalisation)
for more details.

## 6\. Relational Databases

{dm} is built upon relational data models but it is not a database
itself. Databases are systems for data management and many of them are
constructed as relational databases, e.g. SQLite, MySQL, MSSQL,
Postgres. As you can guess from the names of the databases, SQL, short
for Structured Querying Language, plays an important role: it was
invented for the purpose of querying relational databases.

In production, the data is stored in a relational database and {dm} is
used to work with the data.

Therefore, {dm} can copy data [from and to
databases](https://cynkra.github.io/dm/articles/dm.html#copy), and works
transparently with both in-memory data and with relational database
systems.

For example, let’s create a local SQLite database and copy the `dm`
object to it:

``` r
con_sqlite <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite())
con_sqlite
#> <SQLiteConnection>
#>   Path: 
#>   Extensions: TRUE
DBI::dbListTables(con_sqlite)
#> character(0)

copy_dm_to(con_sqlite, dm)
DBI::dbListTables(con_sqlite)
#> [1] "airlines_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1" "airports_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1"
#> [3] "flights_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1"  "planes_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1"  
#> [5] "sqlite_stat1"                   "sqlite_stat4"                  
#> [7] "weather_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1"
```

In the opposite direction, `dm` can also be populated with data from a
DB. Unfortunately, keys currently can be learned only for MSSQL and
Postgres, but not for SQLite. Therefore, the dm contains the tables but
not the keys:

``` r
dm_from_src(con_sqlite)
#> Keys could not be queried, use `learn_keys = FALSE` to mute this message.
#> ── Table source ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> src:  sqlite 3.30.1 []
#> ── Metadata ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> Tables: `airlines_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1`, `airports_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1`, `flights_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1`, `planes_2020_08_28_07_13_03_1`, `sqlite_stat1`, … (7 total)
#> Columns: 62
#> Primary keys: 0
#> Foreign keys: 0
```

Remember to terminate the database connection:

``` r
DBI::dbDisconnect(con_sqlite)
```
