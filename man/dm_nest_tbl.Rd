dm_nest_tbl(dm, table, into = NULL)

dm_pack_tbl(dm, table, into = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dm}{A dm.}

\description{
\code{dm_nest_tbl()} converts a child table to a nested column in its parent
table.
The child table should not have children itself (i.e. it needs to be a
\emph{terminal child table}).

\code{dm_pack_tbl()} converts a parent table to a packed column in its child
table.
The parent table should not have parent tables itself (i.e. it needs to be a
\emph{terminal parent table}).
