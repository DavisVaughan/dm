#' Flatten part of a `dm` into a wide table
#'
#' Gather all information of interest in one place in a wide table (on a database-[`dm`] a
#' temporary table will be created).
#' If referential integrity is given among the tables of the data model, the resulting
#' table of this function will contain as many rows as the table `start` does (exceptions are
#' `join = anti_join` (result is empty table with same columns as `start`) and `join = right_join`
#' (number of rows equal to or larger than those of `start`)).
#' For more information please refer to `vignette("dm-joining")`.
#'
#' @inheritParams dm_join_to_tbl
#' @param start Table to start from. From this table all outgoing foreign key relations are
#' considered to establish a processing order for the joins. An interesting choice could be
#' for example a fact table in a star schema.
#' @param ... Unquoted table names to include in addition to `start`. The order of the tables here determines
#' the order of the joins. If empty, all tables that can be reached are included.
#' If this includes tables which aren't direct neighbours of `start`,
#' it will only work with `dm_squash_to_tbl()` (given one of the allowed join-methods).
#' `tidyselect` is supported, cf. [dplyr::select()].
#' @family flattening functions
#'
#' @details With the `...` left empty, this function joins all the tables of your [`dm`]
#' object together, that can be reached from table `start` in the direction of the foreign
#' key relations (pointing from child table to parent table), using the foreign key relations to
#' determine the parameter `by` for the necessary joins.
#' The result is one table with unique column names.
#' Use the `...` if you want to control which tables should be joined to table `start`.
#'
#' How does filtering affect the result?
#'
#' **Case 1**, either no filter conditions are set in the `dm`, or only in a part unconnected to
#' table `start`:
#' The necessary disambiguations of the column names are performed first. Then all
#' involved foreign tables are joined to table `start` successively with the join function given in
#' parameter `join`.
#'
#' **Case 2**, filter conditions are set for at least one table connected to `start`:
#' Disambiguation is performed initially if necessary. Table `start` is calculated using `tbl(dm, "start")`. This implies
#' that the effect of the filters on this table is taken into account. For `right_join`, `full_join` and `nest_join` an error
#' is thrown in case filters are set, because the filters won't affect right hand side tables and thus the result will be
#' incorrect in general (and calculating the effects on all RHS-tables would be time-consuming and is not supported;
#' if desired call `dm_apply_filters()` first to achieve this effect.).
#' For all other join types filtering only `start` is enough, since the effect is passed on by the
#' successive joins.
#'
#' Mind, that calling `dm_flatten_to_tbl()` with `join = right_join` and no table order determined in the `...`
#' would not lead to a well-defined result, if two or more foreign tables are to be joined to `start`. The resulting
#' table would depend on the order the tables are listed in the `dm`. Therefore trying this results
#' in a warning.
#'
#' Since `join = nest_join()` does not make sense in this direction (LHS = child table, RHS = parent table: for valid key constraints
#' each nested column entry would be a tibble of 1 row), an error is thrown, if this method is chosen.
#'
#' @return A single table, resulting of consecutively joining
#' all tables involved to table `start`.
