#' Flatten part of a `dm` into a wide table
#'
#' Gather all information of interest in one place in a wide table (on a database-[`dm`] a
#' temporary table will be created).
#' If referential integrity is given among the tables of the data model, the resulting
#' table of this function will contain as many rows as the table `start` does (exceptions are
#' `join = anti_join` (result is empty table with same columns as `start`) and `join = right_join` (
#' number of rows equal to those of the join-partner of `start`)).
#' For more information please refer to `vignette("dm-joining")`.
#'
#' @inheritParams cdm_join_to_tbl
#' @param start Table to start from. From this table all outgoing foreign key relations are
#' considered to establish a processing order for the joins. An interesting choice could be
#' for example a fact table in a star schema.
#' @param ... Unquoted table names to include in addition to `start`. If empty, all tables that can
#' be reached are included.
#' @family flattening functions
#'
#' @details With the `...` left empty, this function joins all the tables of your [`dm`]
#' object together, that can be reached from table `start` in the direction of the foreign
#' key relations (pointing from child table to parent table), using the foreign key relations to
#' determine the parameter `by` for the necessary joins.
#' The result is one table with unique column names.
#' Use the `...` if you want to control which tables should be joined to table `start`.
#'
#' **How does filtering affect the result?**
#'
#' *Case 1*, either no filter conditions are set in the `dm`, or only in a part unconnected to
#' table `start`:
#' The necessary disambiguations of the column names are performed first. Then all
#' involved foreign tables are joined to table `start` successively with the join function given in
#' parameter `join`.
#'
#' *Case 2*, filter conditions are set for at least one table connected to `start`:
#' The result of filtering a `dm` object is necessarily a data model conforming to referential integrity.
#' Consequently, there is no difference between `left_join`, `right_join`, `inner_join` and `full_join`.
#' In this case, `left_join` is being used. Using `semi_join` in `cdm_flatten_to_tbl()` on a filtered `dm`
#' is identical to `tbl(dm, start)`, and `anti_join` is identical to `tbl(dm, start) %>% filter(1 == 0)`.
#' Disambiguation is performed initially if necessary.
#'
#' **join-methods: `join = semi_join()` and `join = anti_join()`**
#'
#' The implementation of this function for `semi_join` and `anti_join` is different from the other join-methods:
#' 1. `dplyr::semi_join()` is successively used to determine which rows of table `start` contain valid lookup-values
#' in the primary key columns of all its included parent tables.
#' 2. For method `join = semi_join`, this is the result of the flattening. For method `join = anti_join`,
#' `dplyr::anti_join()` is calculated between the original table and the result from 1., effectively letting
#' those rows of table `start` remain, whose references are missing in at least one parent table.
#'
#' The result for `semi_join` lets you know which references are intact everywhere.
#' The result from `anti_join` tells you, which references are missing somewhere.
#'
#' **join-method: `join = right_join()`**
#'
#' Mind, that calling `cdm_flatten_to_tbl()` on an unfiltered `dm` with `join = right_join` would not lead
#' to a well-defined result, if two or more foreign tables are to be joined to `start`. The resulting
#' table would depend on the order the tables are listed in the `dm`. Therefore trying this results
#' in an error.
#'
#' @return A wide table resulting of consecutively joining all tables involved to table `start`.
